# Python 3.0 for DataScience

This repository contains libraries of Python that will be used while learning DataScience

Below are the list of libraries covered in this repo.

## Python Libraries

```
* NumPy - for faster  mathematical operations (matrix multiplication, merging arrays etc)

* MatPlot - for plotting graphical representation based on the data given (eg scatter plots 
			,pie chart)
* Pandas - for library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis
			tools for the Python programming language.
```
